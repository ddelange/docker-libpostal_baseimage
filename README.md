# Pelias Libpostal Docker Baseimage

This repository contains the Pelias Libpostal Docker Baseimage. This image is identical to https://github.com/pelias/baseimage but with the additional installation of [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal).

If your container doesn't require `libpostal` then you can save RAM and disk by using the regular Pelias `baseimage` linked above instead.
